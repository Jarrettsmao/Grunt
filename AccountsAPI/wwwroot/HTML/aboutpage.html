            Welcome to Grunt! The website where your reviews get turned into pure, unfiltered silliness! Here, we take your everyday reviews and translate them into caveman speak, making even the most serious feedback sound like it came straight from a stone-age genius. <br>

            But the fun doesn’t stop there. Grunt lets you draw your own silly illustrations to accompany your review! From stick figures to wacky doodles, we encourage you to make your drawings as goofy and outlandish as possible. The more ridiculous, the better! <br>

            <br> <br>
