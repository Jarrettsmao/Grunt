        <h2>About Grunt</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Grunt — the website where your reviews get turned into pure, unfiltered silliness! Here, we take your everyday reviews and translate them into caveman speak, making even the most serious feedback sound like it came straight from a stone-age genius. <br>

            But the fun doesn’t stop there. Grunt lets you draw your own silly illustrations to accompany your review! From stick figures to wacky doodles, we encourage you to make your drawings as goofy and outlandish as possible. The more ridiculous, the better! <br>

        <h2>Why Grunt?</h2>

            Caveman Speak: Turn your thoughts into hilariously primitive language — because who needs big words when you’ve got “Ugh” and “Me like!”? <br>
            
            User-Created Art: Your drawings, your rules. Go wild with the doodles! Whether it’s a potato with arms or a monster on roller skates, let your creativity run free. <br>
            
            Share the Laughs: Once you’ve crafted your masterpiece, share it with friends, family, and followers. Grunt reviews are perfect for spreading joy and giggles. <br>
            At Grunt, we believe that laughter is the best feedback. So go ahead — unleash your inner caveman and create the silliest, funniest reviews you can imagine! <br>
